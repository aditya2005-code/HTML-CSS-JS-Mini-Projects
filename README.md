4.📋To-Do List App with Priority Sorting

## Description

This is a simple web-based To-Do List application that allows users to add tasks with associated priorities (High, Medium, Low). Tasks can be marked as completed using checkboxes, and the list dynamically sorts tasks based on their priority to help users focus on the most important items first.

---

## Features

- Add tasks with priority selection.
- Display tasks sorted by priority (High → Medium → Low).
- Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox (text gets strikethrough).
- Real-time console logging of current tasks and completed tasks.
- Clear input after task addition.

---

## How to Use

1. **Add a Task:**
   - Enter the task description in the task input box.
   - Select the priority from the dropdown.
   - Click the **Add Task** button.
   
2. **View Tasks:**
   - Tasks will be displayed in a list sorted by priority.
   - Each task shows a checkbox to mark it complete or incomplete.

3. **Mark Task Completed:**
   - Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it completed (it will be crossed out).
   - Uncheck to mark it incomplete.

---

## Code Structure Overview

- **HTML Elements:**
  - Task input field
  - Priority dropdown selector
  - Add Task button
  - Ordered list (`<ol>`) for tasks display

- **JavaScript:**
  - Array `todo` stores task objects: `{ task: string, priority: string }`
  - `addTaskButton` event listener adds tasks and calls `displayTasksByPriority()`
  - `displayTasksByPriority()`:
    - Sorts `todo` array by priority
    - Clears and repopulates task list with sorted tasks
    - Attaches checkbox event listeners to handle completion toggling
